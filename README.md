Creative technologist with 12+ years of experience in the software-driven visual effects industry, including 6+ years in leadership. I've led cross-functional teams of artists and developers under intense production pressure - delivering both creatively polished and technically robust solutions.

I’ve built on-prem and cloud-based pipelines, deployed machine learning models with Docker and Kubernetes, and developed full-stack applications across the frontend and backend. I also co-founded a French tech startup focused on AI tools for media workflows.

 I just can't learn one thing at a time.

## 🔭 Currently Working On:
- A **Rust + Tauri desktop app** for creative professionals (got curios how to build cross platform and avoid packaging all for different OS)
- **Machine Learning projects** using PyTorch and TensorFlow (like to test new algorithms and papers)
- Advancing my knowledge of **cybersecurity** via TryHackMe and practical labs (kinda really must have these days...)
