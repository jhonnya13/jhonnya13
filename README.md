Creative technologist with 12+ years of experience in the software-driven visual effects industry, including 6+ years in leadership. I've led cross-functional teams of artists and developers under intense production pressure - delivering both creatively polished and technically robust solutions.

Iâ€™ve built on-prem and cloud-based pipelines, deployed machine learning models with Docker and Kubernetes, and developed full-stack applications across the frontend and backend. I also co-founded a French tech startup focused on AI tools for media workflows.
